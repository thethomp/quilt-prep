DESCRIPTION: QuiltPrep is a Java application written to simplify the task
of figuring out how much fabric to buy for a particular pattern. You simply 
put the width of the roll of fabric that the store offers in the "Width of 
fabric" field, input however many squares and strips your pattern requires,
and QuiltPrep will make the calculation to produce the optimal length of fabric
you will have to buy from the store in order to give you all the squares and strips
that you need.

TO RUN: You need to have some version of the Java Runtime Environment installed on 
your machine in order to run the program. Simply double click on the .jar file to 
start the program.
